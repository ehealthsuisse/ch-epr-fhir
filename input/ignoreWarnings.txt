# IG Publisher limitations
No types could be determined from the search string, so the types can't be checked

# Raised JIRA on hl7 side to add to THO, see issue UP-621 https://jira.hl7.org/browse/UP-621 or https://github.com/ehealthsuisse/ch-epr-fhir/issues/190

# Wait for update to BALP
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# Caused through underlying profile
The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex

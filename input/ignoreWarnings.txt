A definition for CodeSystem 'urn:ihe:event-type-code' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated
A definition for CodeSystem 'urn:e-health-suisse:event-type-code' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated

# Inactive codes used in value sets
The code '264358009' is valid but is not active

# Non-conformance to 'preferred' value sets
None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Practice Setting Code Value Set' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/c80-practice-codes|4.0.1), and a coding is recommended to come from this value set (codes = urn:oid:2.16.756.5.30.1.127.3.5#1051)

# IHE things
For the complex type Coding, consider using a pattern rather than a fixed value to avoid over-constraining the instance
The definition for the element 'Consent.provision.code' binds to the value set 'http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/consent-content-code' which is experimental, but this structure is not labeled as experimental

# IG Publisher limitations
No types could be determined from the search string, so the types can't be checked

# Raised JIRA on hl7 side to add to THO, see issue UP-621 https://jira.hl7.org/browse/UP-621 or https://github.com/ehealthsuisse/ch-epr-fhir/issues/190
Unknown code '26' in the CodeSystem 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/object-role' version '1.0.0'

# Wait for update to BALP
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

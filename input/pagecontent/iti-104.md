### Scope

This transaction communicates patient information, including corroborating demographic data, after a patient’s identity is established, modified or merged or after the key corroborating demographic data has been modified.

### Actor Roles

**Actor:** Patient Identity Source   
**Role:** Provides notification to the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager for any patient identification related events including: creation, updates, merges, etc.   
**Actor:** Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager   
**Role:** Serves a well-defined set of Patient Identification Domains. Based on information provided in each Patient Identification Domain by a Patient Identity Source Actor, it manages the cross-referencing of patient identifiers across Patient Identification Domains.

### Referenced Standards
[Patient Identifier Cross-referencing for mobile (PIXm), Rev. 3.0.0 – Trial-Implementation, November 8, 2021](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/PIXm/index.html)

### Messages

<div>{% include PIXM_ActorDiagram_ITI-104.svg %}</div>

### Trigger Events

The Add Patient message is triggered when a new patient is added to a Patient Identity Source.
The Revise Patient message is triggered when the patient information is revised within a Patient Identity Source (e.g., change in patient name, patient address, etc.).
A Resolve Duplicate Patient message is triggered when the Patient Identity Source does a merge within its Patient Identification Domain.

### Message Semantics

The same message semantic apply as in [2:3.104.4.1.2](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/PIXm/ITI-104.html#23104412-message-semantics) and [2:3.104.4.2.2](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/PIXm/ITI-104.html#23104422-message-semantics) Message Semantics.

The patient data (see [Patient example](Patient-PatientPIXmFeed.html)) SHALL be conform to the PIXm Patient profile with the canonical url
[http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-epr-mhealth/StructureDefinition/ch-pixm-patient](StructureDefinition-ch-pixm-patient.html). 
If the patient is already registered in a community, the MPI-PID SHALL be provided as an identifier. The EPR-SPID 
as an identifier MAY be added. The birthname can be added with the ISO 21090 qualifier extension, the religion SHALL not be added.

### Expected Actions Consumer played by Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager

If the MPI-PID is provided as an identifier the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager SHALL use the MPI-PID to correlate
the patient in the community.

### Message Example

See [Bundle example](Bundle-BundlePIXmFeed.html) (and the corresponding [profile](StructureDefinition-ch-pixm-bundle.html)) for the Mobile Patient Identity Feed **request**.   
See [Bundle example](Bundle-BundlePIXmResponse.html) (and the corresponding [profile](StructureDefinition-ch-pixm-bundle-response.html)) for the Mobile Patient Identity Feed **response**.

### Security Consideration
TLS SHALL be used. This national extension enforces authentication and authorization of access to the
Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager using the IUA profile with basic access token. Consequently
the Patient Identity Feed FHIR [ITI-104] request must authorize using the Incorporate Access Token
[ITI-72] transaction of the IUA profile.

This section specifies Swiss national extensions to the Mobile Access to Health Documents (MHD) with XDS on FHIR Profile, which is [published](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/index.html) as an IHE ITI Trial Implementation profile.

The national extensions adds an additional transaction toâ‰ˆfrom the Document Source to the Document Recipient. 

### Scope  
An EPR App can query, retrieve or publish data to an EPR community using the transaction of the MHD profile. 
An EPR App can Update Limited Document Metadata for a published document with this national extension.  

###	Use Cases  
In addition to the Document Sharing Use Case for MHD the national extension defines the following Use Cases:

#### Limited Document Metadata from a Health Care professional with a primary system
A Healthcare professional has published a document in his own community for the patient but needs to update the metadata of the document. 
The healthcare professional updates the metadata (e.g. title) in the primary systems and submits the updated metadata to the community. The
metadata which is allowed to be updated is defined in Annex 5.1 1.12.1.

###	Actors and Transactions

This figure shows the actors directly involved in the _Mobile Access to Health Documents_ Profile and the relevant 
transactions between them.

### Actor options  
For all actors the Comprehensive Metadata Option and the XDS on FHIR Option SHALL be supported. For all actors the Metadata as defined in Annex 3 SHALL be supported.

### Required Actor Groupings  
The Actors Document Recipient and Document Responder MUST be grouped according to the XDS on FHIR grouping condition see Table 33.3-1: MHD - Actors Required Grouping.
This national extension enforces authentication and authorization for access control. Therefore actors of this profile must be grouped with actors of other profiles according to the following table:

| Actor                                         | Required Grouping         | Optionality |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Document Recipient                            | IUA Resource Server       | R           |
| Document Responder                            | IUA Authorization Client  | R           |
| Document Source                               | IUA Authorization Client  | R           |
